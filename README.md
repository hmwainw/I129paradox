This is the data repository for the paper titled "The Iodine-129 Paradox in the Nuclear Fuel Cycleâ€” Is Dilution a Solution?" by Wainwright et al. The data and codes were created by Kay Whiteaker and Haruko Wainwright.

Mass flow analysis
-------------------
In MassFlowAnalysis/,

(1) i129_massFlow_readBurnupDataset.ipynb: read the I-129 mass generated in a nuclear reactor after a given burn-up
* I-129 inventory in SNF from the publicly available generic PWR data library, which is generated by the Serpent 2 fuel depletion code (Elter, 2020)

(2) i129_reactorEffluents_calculations.ipynb: calculate the effluent release from reactors (loss from SNF; negligible compared to the loss to the low-level waste)
* The amount of I-129 released as the reactor effluents is estimated using the 2019 effluent report (Davis, 2021).

(3) i129_massFlow_calculations.ipynb: calculate the amount of I-129 in SNF, and the mass flow within a reprocessing plant
* I-129 mass in LLW as the average amount of I-129 sent to the LLW repository by Columbia Generating Station from 2011 to 2021 (NRC, 2023a).

(4) I120_Repository_Model.ipynb: calculate the release rate of I-129 from SNF in the high-level waste repository, compute the concentration at the well location using the flow and transport model (PFLOTRAN), and calculate the cumulative release over 1M years
*Note that all the values were converted from Bq to Kg using conv.xlsx
* The model is described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12805. PFLOTRAN is available at pflotran.org

Release from reprocessing plants and Surface water concentration
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In Release_Concentrations/
- database.xlsx: surface water concentration data in Europe from literature (see database_readme.dox)
  * the database is originally published under the DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13685679, and modified to add the SRS data 
- plot_SRS_surfacewater.ipynb: plot the surface water concentrations at SRS (FM-6.csv and FMC-002F.csv; Figure S1)
- release_plots.xlsx: annual release from La Hague and Sellafield
- effluents_concentrations.xlsx: summary statistics of concentration data
- release_vs_conc.m: plot release vs concentration (Figure 3)
